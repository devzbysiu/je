# When releasing to crates.io:
#
# - last check for all TODO, FIXME, expect, unwrap.
# - re-read and final polish of documentation
# - run cargo udeps
# - run cargo clippy
# - recheck log statements (informative, none left that were just for development, ...)
# - Update CHANGELOG.md.
# - Update version numbers in Cargo.yml, Cargo.toml, install section of readme.
# - verify CI result
# - run cargo test on dependent crates
# - cargo publish
# - merge dev branch into master
# - create git tag with version number
#
